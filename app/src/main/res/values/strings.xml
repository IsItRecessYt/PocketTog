    <string name="helpfulHintsText0">Here at Pocket Tog, we are dedicated to giving you the best possible products money can get you. Here are some hints at how to achieve a great
        looking photo!</string>
    <string name="helpfulHintsText1">Do not enlarge your picture before sending. Stretched images distort pixels and make editing very difficult.</string>
    <string name="helpfulHintsText2">Lighting is essential to every photographers tool suite. If your image is too bright or too dark, then the photo will not be changed much.</string>
    <string name="helpfulHintsText3">Modern day cell phones have editing tools that allow users to edit their own photos. While this is a good alternative to Pocket Tog, the tools do not
        come with the expertise that Pocket Tog does. With that said, please make sure that photos submitted are unedited. Let the professionals do the editing.We promise to edit every
        photo you send us, but sometimes the before and after are not as different as expected.</string>
    <string name="helpfulHintsText4">Obscene or crude materials are not accepted at Pocket Tog. Any photo that is submitted, reviewed, and deemed pornographic or offensive will not be
        edited and discarded. Continued misuse of the app will block transactions from the offending users email.</string>
